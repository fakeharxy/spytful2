<h3> Spytful, a quick intro </h3>

<h4> Aim </h4>

<p> In Spytful, players take the role of generals, looking to conquer as many castles over the course of the game. Just like in real life, players can only move by creating routes of cards secretly, whilst trying to block their opponents routes using a mix of cunning and a dash of luck. </p>

<h4> Starting </h4>

<p> Use the Lobby to organise a game. The board will be made up of seven different coloured hexes, as well as some water hexes which cannot be moved on to. There will be 7 castles on the board, all empty to begin the game. Each player is dealt 2 cards and you are ready to begin. </p>

<h4> Your turn </h4>

<p> The game is played in turns. On your turn, you can, in any order: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Drop in to the map</li>
  <li>Add cards to your movement stack</li>
  <li>Place one outpost on the board</li>
  <li>Complete a route using the cards in your movement stack</li>
</ul>

<p> Once you have completed as many of these actions as you would like, you end your turn by drawing new card(s) from the pool or deck. You will not be allowed to perform any other actions after you have drawn cards, and you must click the 'End Turn' button after this is done.
