<h3> Spytful, a quick intro </h3>

<h4> Aim </h4>

<p> In Spytful, players take the role of generals, looking to conquer as many castles over the course of the game. Just like in real life, players can only move by creating routes of cards secretly, whilst trying to block their opponents routes using a mix of cunning and a dash of luck. </p>

<h4> Starting </h4>

<p> Use the Lobby to organise a game. The board will be made up of seven different coloured hexes, as well as some water hexes which cannot be moved on to. There will be 7 castles on the board, all empty to begin the game. Each player is dealt 2 cards and you are ready to begin. </p>
